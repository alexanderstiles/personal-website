        Welcome to my website!  I'm Alex, an American expatriate who grew up in
        Europe (Scotland and Spain).  I work for Ballast Lane Applications, a
        custom software development firm in Boston.  In May I will receive my
        B.A. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia, with a minor
        in Technology Entrepreneurship.  A permanent EU resident, I will be
        living in Amsterdam as of June.  My passion is web development and
        related modern front-end technologies.  When I'm not building websites
        for corporate clients, you can find me traveling, hiking, and seeking
        out excellent food.  
        <br /> <br /> Check out some of my favorite corporate and personal
        projects that I have worked on below!
