        Hi! I'm Alex. An American expatriate who grew up in Europe, I am working for Ballast
        Lane Applications, a custom software development firm in Boston, while
        completing a B.A. in Computer Science and a minor in Technology
        Entrepreneurship at the University of Virginia. I am enthusiastic about
        web-development and related modern front-end technologies. In my free
        time I enjoy a combination of traveling, hiking, and good food. <br /> <br />I will
        be based in Amsterdam starting June 2022. <br /> <br /> Some of my favorite corporate
        and personal projects are below.
